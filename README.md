ü§ñ AI Features
Field Detection
Groq AI Integration: Advanced language model for intelligent field mapping
Multi-language Support: Handles English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish headers
Smart Pattern Recognition: Understands domain-specific terminology like "Gencod" (French for EAN)
Fallback Detection: Robust fuzzy matching when AI is unavailable
EAN/UPC Detection
Smart Code Classification: Distinguishes between EAN codes and supplier codes
Multiple Standards: Supports EAN-13, EAN-8, and UPC-A formats
Context-Aware: Uses column names to improve classification accuracy
üìä Supported Data Formats
Input Files
CSV: Auto-detects encoding (UTF-8, Latin-1, CP1252) and delimiters
Excel: .xlsx and .xls formats with automatic sheet detection
Expected Data Structure
The system can handle various column naming conventions:

Field Type	Common Names
Product Code	Gencod, EAN, Code, SKU, Reference, C√≥digo
Product Name	Name, Description, Product, Designation
Price	Price, Prix, Pre√ßo, Valor, Cost
Quantity	Quantity, Qty, Stock, Quantidade
Output Formats
CSV: Standard comma-separated format
JSON: Structured data with metadata
Reports: Human-readable processing summaries
‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Environment Variables

üö® Troubleshooting
Common Issues
File Reading Errors:
Check file encoding (try saving as UTF-8)
Verify CSV delimiter (comma, semicolon, tab)
Ensure Excel files aren't corrupted
Field Detection Problems:
Review column names for clarity
Use manual mapping for complex structures
Check sample data quality
API Key Issues:
Verify Groq API key format (gsk_...)
Check API quota and rate limits
Use fallback detection if API unavailable
Error Messages
"No products extracted": Check field mapping and data quality
"File format unsupported": Use CSV, XLSX, or XLS files
"API key invalid": Verify Groq API key format and validity
